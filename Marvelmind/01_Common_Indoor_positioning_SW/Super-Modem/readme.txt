If your current Super-Modem software version is 7.000 or higher, 
you can update both low level and high level software via dashboard's firmware menu.

If your current Super-Modem software version is less than 7.000, 
you need to reflash micro-SD card inside the Super-Modem for update. 
Super-Modem software (Firmware and MicroSD card image) is supplied in separate archive because it is pretty large.
